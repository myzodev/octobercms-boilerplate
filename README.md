# OctoberCMS Boilerplate

This repository provides a **boilerplate** for building projects with **OctoberCMS**. It is pre-configured with a modern frontend workflow, including **TailwindCSS**, **Alpine.js**, and a basic **JavaScript** and **CSS** folder structure. The goal is to streamline development by offering a ready-to-use setup, saving time on initial configuration.
